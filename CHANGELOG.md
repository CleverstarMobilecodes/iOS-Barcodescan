## 5.0.1

- Fixed issue with orientation changes not registering under some circumstances.

Special thanks to [@juliangoacher](https://github.com/juliangoacher) for all of the work on this release!

## 5.0.0

- Removed MTBTorchModeAuto
- Added error handling when setting torch mode.

Special thanks to [@shagedorn](https://github.com/shagedorn) for all of the work on this release!

## 4.0.0

- Setting the `camera` property directly is now deprecated in favor of the more-helpful `setCamera:error:` method.
- Methods that accept an error argument now have a return value to satisfy Xcode analyzer.

Special thanks to [@shagedorn](https://github.com/shagedorn) for all of the work on this release!

## 3.1.0

- Fixed issue where calling a method on UIImagePickerController could prompt a rejection from the App Store if a `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` is not provided in the Info.plist file. Details are [here](https://github.com/mikebuss/MTBBarcodeScanner/issues/86). Thanks @brblakley!
- Fixed an issue with setting the camera using the `camera` property setter

## 3.0.0

- Errors are now propagated to the `startScanning` methods. You may now supply an NSError to this method that will be updated in the event scanning could not be started.
- The scanning methods have now been changed to:

```
- (void)startScanningWithError:(NSError **)error;
- (void)startScanningWithResultBlock:(void (^)(NSArray *codes))resultBlock error:(NSError **)error;
```

## 2.1.0

- Now uses AVCaptureFocusModeContinuousAutoFocus by default, per issue [#81](https://github.com/mikebuss/MTBBarcodeScanner/issues/81). Thanks [@JacopoKenzo](https://github.com/JacopoKenzo)!

## 2.0.3

- Fixed bug where `resultBlock` could be called when nil. Thanks [@navicor90](https://github.com/navicor90)!

## 2.0.2

- Fixed bug with Carthage support and missing import

## 2.0.1

- Added a minor bug fix for CocoaPods support

## 2.0.0

- Added support for Carthage. Thanks [@hardikdevios](https://github.com/hardikdevios)!

## 1.9.1

- Removed NSLog statement Thanks [@brblakley](https://github.com/brblakley)!

## 1.9.0

- Added support for tapping the view to focus the camera

## 1.8.11

- Fixed an issue with iOS 7 support. Thanks [@kiwox](https://github.com/kiwox)!

## 1.8.10

- Fixed an issue with freezing the camera and stopping capture in the demo project. Thanks [@huuang](https://github.com/huuang)!

## 1.8.9

- Fixed issue with scanning still images on iOS 7.

## 1.8.8

- Fixed flicker issue with setting `torchMode` property. To avoid flickering when turning on the torch, set the `torchMode` property *after* you call `startScanning`.

## 1.8.7

- Setting the `scanRect` value now correctly checks the video orientation. Thanks [@peterpaulis](https://github.com/peterpaulis)!

## 1.8.6

- Added support for capturing still images with new `captureStillImage:` method. Thanks [@peterpaulis](https://github.com/peterpaulis)!

## 1.8.5

- Fixed issue where the `scanRect` property needed to be explicitly set in order to scan barcodes.

## 1.8.4

- Added the ability to limit scanning to only a section of the screen using the new `scanRect` property. See the file `MTBAdvancedExampleViewController` in the demo project for an example. Thanks [@Shannon-Yang](https://github.com/Shannon-Yang)!

## 1.8.3

- Added the `didStartScanningBlock` property, which stores a block that's called when the barcode scanner initializes. This is useful for presenting an activity spinner while the scanner loads. Thanks to [@jaybowong](https://github.com/jaybowong) for the suggestion!
- Exposed the `resultBlock` property, which will allow the results to be dynamically set before or after the scanner starts scanning.
- Added a `startScanning` method, which will start scanning using the block properties set by the user. See README for sample usage of this.

## 1.8.2

- Added the `previewLayer` property to expose the underlying preview layer. For those not using auto layout, it may be necessary to adjust this layer when the device rotates.

## 1.8.1

- The `hasTorch` method can now be called when the scanner is not scanning. (Thanks [felipowsky](https://github.com/felipowsky)!)

## 1.8.0

- Added `freezeCapture` and `unfreezeCapture` methods. (Thanks [felipowsky](https://github.com/felipowsky)!)
